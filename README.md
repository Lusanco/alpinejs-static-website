# Alpine.js Static Website

A modern and responsive static website built with Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS to showcase information about a church.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Alpine.js IntelliSense Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=adrianwilczynski.alpine-js-intellisense)
- [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Features:

- **Alpine.js:** A lightweight and declarative JavaScript framework that enhances interactivity without requiring a complex build process.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Simplifies styling with utility-first classes for rapid and responsive website design.

## Getting Started:

### Clone the Repository:

- HTTPS:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/Lusanco/alpinejs-static-website.git
```

- GitHub CLI:
```Bash
gh repo clone Lusanco/alpinejs-static-website
```

### Install Dependencies:

```Bash
cd alpinejs-static-website
npm install
```

## Development:

### Start the Development Server:

You can start the development server with the following command:

```Bash
npm run dev
```

Then, use the Live Server extension in VS Code to view the page in your web browser on localhost.

### Building for Production:

To create an optimized production build, run:

```Bash
npm run build
```

This generates the TailwindCSS `build.css` in the `src/css/build.css` folder.

## Additional Notes:

- Project History: This project was completed on September 4, 2023 for a client before I officially started my software engineering career. While the file structure has been updated for clarity, the original code and approach from the initial project have been preserved. This project is intended as a showcase of my earlier web development work.
